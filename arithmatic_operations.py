10.01#Heare 10.01 is floting point number.
print(10+3)  #This is an Addition operator.
print(10-3)  #This is an Subtraction operator.
print(10*3)  #This is an Multiplaction operator.
#We have two kind of devision.
10/3#This will give your answer in floting point.
10//3#This will give your answer in integer.
print(10/3)
print(10//3)
print(10%3)  #This is an Modules operator Which will return reminder.
print(10**3)  #This is an Exponent operator Which will return sqare/cube of a number.

#Argumanted assignment operator.

x=10#If you want to increment 10 by 3
x=x+3#We will take x=x+3 and value 13 will be stored in X
print(x)#and print x, This is one type of incrementing a number.

x=10
x+=3 #This line exactly what is writen in line no:-18,(+=)This is what the Argumented assignment operator.
print(x)

x=10
x-=3
print(x)

x=10
x*=3
print(x)
